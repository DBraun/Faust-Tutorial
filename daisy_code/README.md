# Faust to Daisy

In this section, you'll learn about deploying code to the Daisy microcontroller ecosystem, specifically the Pod.

# Faust to _____

The Daisy ecosystem is only one of many destinations to which Faust can be deployed. For other examples, check out the Faust2appls section.

# Pod

The Pod is the barebones Daisy Seed with 65MB memory plus two knobs, two buttons, and an encoder. An encoder is like a knob that can rotate unlimited amounts in either direction.

# Hello World Synthesizer

Let's make a "synthesizer". You won't be able to control the synthesiser with MIDI, but you will he able to control the pitch with the knob and trigger notes with a button. We'll use the Faust Libraries quantizers.lib to make our pitch fit into a scale.
